## Executive Synopsis

- [[00:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=0) There is a massive opportunity to own the global payments network; it could be bigger than card networks, but there’s a worry about replacing one king with another.
- [[00:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=0) Bitcoin is not just digital gold; the team aims to put Bitcoin to work as a network for moving value globally 24/7 at low cost.
- [[00:00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=0) In cross-border payments, fiat is still needed; Bitcoin’s liquidity and speed can enable rapid transfers, making it a viable option despite volatility.
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Bitcoin sits on a continuum between store of value and medium of exchange; a ledger read/write by the global population without intermediaries is a key innovation.
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Realizing money reform requires a truly neutral network with governance and decentralization; building on Bitcoin is hard and must be a trusted substrate.
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Over a decade, two big changes emerged: Bitcoin as censorship-resistant store of value and medium, and stable coins enabling the unbanked to hold dollars.
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) The asset can be both a store of value and a medium of exchange, but each asset lies on a continuum rather than being purely one or the other.
- [[00:08:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=488) Corporations pursuing their own chains (Tempo, Arc) echoes Libra; decentering and neutrality are hard, and there’s skepticism about corp chains’ long-term trust.
- [[00:08:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=488) Banks are realizing the value of open networks and are building on Ethereum and other chains; there is a perceived “land grab” to own the network.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Open standards tend to win; Linux is an example of openness powering widespread adoption; crypto is expected to move toward open, neutral networks in payments.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) There may be an impactful, unexpected application (“nuclear app”) once regulatory clarity improves; payments could move on open networks beyond stable coins.
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) Productivity hack: triaging inbox with layered task lists and using emoji to signal urgency.
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) Book recommendation: If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, a thought experiment on AI doomsday and race dynamics.
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) Founders should ignore advice from incumbents because things are moving rapidly across multiple domains.
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) The smallest hill to die on: AI’s impact will be massive even if models stop improving; the economy will be transformed.

## Deep Dive Notes


### Bitcoin as a global payments network

**Key Claims + Reasoning:**
- [[00:00:03]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=3) Owning the network of global payments is a massively profitable business; it can be larger than existing card networks.  
- [[00:00:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=15) The biggest misconception is treating Bitcoin as digital gold; the team aims to “put Bitcoin to work” by using the network to move value globally 24/7 at a low cost (not just holding the asset).  
- [[00:00:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=28) In this phase, people still want fiat for cross-border transfers, so you should use the most liquid globally available asset (Bitcoin) because volatility doesn’t matter if you can settle in a split second.  
- [[00:01:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=70) Lessons from Libra: reforming money requires a network that is truly neutral with governance and decentralization; a “corp chain” won’t be trusted, so building on Bitcoin provides a substrate that everybody can truly trust.  
- [[00:02:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=120) Over time, two major shifts—Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant store of value and a medium of exchange, and stable coins enabling people who can’t hold dollars to hold a dollar-equivalent—have changed the crypto landscape.  
- [[00:03:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=200) There is a lasting question about whether an asset can be both a store of value and a medium of exchange, and how to achieve both within one asset.

**Examples/Stories:**
- [[00:01:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=60) Libra (Facebook’s crypto project) is used as a reference point; the speaker and others were part of the Libra founding team.  
- [[00:01:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=70) The speaker notes they “call themselves… Bitcoin plumbers” and are focused on using Bitcoin’s network for value movement, not just the asset.  
- [[00:01:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=100) Libra’s technology is described as “the most advanced technology of its time,” with other teams adopting that work; this contrasts with the emphasis on Bitcoin’s trust substrate.  
- [[00:01:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=110) The emphasis on regulators’ experience over four years reinforces the Libra lesson about needing a neutral, governance-backed network.

**Counterpoints / Nuance:**
- [[00:00:04]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=4) Acknowledges a tension: even if the network is valuable, there is a personal hope that it doesn’t fully replace current systems (“I really hope it doesn't succeed because otherwise we will have swapped one king with a different one”).  
- [[00:00:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=50) The reality of infrastructure inversion: fiat currency remains important in cross-border transfers during this phase, suggesting Bitcoin’s utility must align with fiat use rather than replace it immediately.  
- [[00:01:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=90) Building on Bitcoin is described as extremely hard (comparable to “building for space”), indicating technical and developmental challenges to wield Bitcoin as an infrastructure backbone.  
- [[00:02:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=160) The emphasis on governance and decentralization as prerequisites for trust implies that purely technical capability isn’t enough; social/organizational design matters.

**Practical Takeaways:**
- [[00:01:15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=75) Aim to build a neutral, governance-enabled Bitcoin-based payments substrate to cultivate broad trust.  
- [[00:02:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=120) Prepare to combine Bitcoin with stable coins to meet market needs (responding to Libra-era lessons and enabling those without traditional banking to hold dollars).  
- [[00:03:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=180) Be aware of and plan for the substantial difficulty of building on Bitcoin; invest in creating a robust, trustworthy infrastructure rather than expecting easy deployment.  
- [[00:03:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=220) Design for a hybrid reality where fiat remains central in the near term, while leveraging Bitcoin’s network for fast, low-cost movement of value across borders.

### Misconceptions: Bitcoin as digital gold

**Key Claims + Reasoning:**
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Claim: Assets sit on a continuum between store of value and medium of exchange; Bitcoin is not purely one or the other. Reasoning: gold is often cited as a store of value and a crisis medium of exchange, but it’s impractical for everyday use; historically, assets tend to start as store of value and then become a medium of exchange over time.
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Claim: The question of “how to achieve both” (store of value and medium of exchange) within a single asset is an open one; Bitcoin’s behavior reflects this continuum.
- [[00:04:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=260) Claim: Bitcoin’s asset-side innovation is the ability to write and read from a ledger as a global, collective population without intermediaries — that is a major breakthrough.
- [[00:04:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=280) Claim: Bitcoin is also a network — a way to transfer value without relying on traditional intermediaries, which matters beyond just the ledger.
- [[00:05:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=350) Claim: The Libra experience illustrates the difficulty of decentralization and the perception of corporate-led chains; even with democratic processes, many people viewed Libra as a “corp chain.”
- [[00:07:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=420) Claim: The Libra project’s ultimate fate wasn’t solely about regulation; decentralizing such a network would have been a major challenge regardless of regulators.
- [[00:08:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=480) Claim: Over more than a decade, only a handful of crypto networks have succeeded in transitioning to true permissionless operation — perhaps two or three.

**Examples/Stories:**
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Example: Gold is a store of value but would be impractical as a crisis medium of exchange (shaving tiny pieces for transactions).
- [[00:04:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=260) Example: Early banks issued IOU-style paper credentials; the paper became the medium of exchange while the stored value sat in the vault.
- [[00:05:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=350) Example: Libra’s attempt to decentralize showed real democratic votes and governance, but observers still perceived it as a corporate chain.
- [[00:07:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=420) Example: Libra shut down and sold; IP contributions persisted in Genius; regulators’ stance was not the sole failure point.
- [[00:08:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=500) Example: There was a pre-committed design effort to make Libra permissionless with strong market design; still, decentralization proved extremely challenging.
- [[00:08:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=517) Example: The historical reality that only a few networks have managed the permissionless transition in crypto.

**Counterpoints / Nuance:**
- [[00:04:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=270) Nuance: While the ledger innovation is profound, Bitcoin should not be viewed only as a ledger; it is also a network, and the combination matters for how value moves.
- [[00:06:10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=370) Nuance: The Libra lesson is not just about regulators; it highlights how people perceive corporate-led efforts and the difficulty of truly decentralized systems.
- [[00:07:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=470) Nuance: Media headlines don’t always reflect the deeper regulatory and structural realities behind crypto projects.
- [[00:08:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=480) Nuance: Decentralization is hard in practice, which helps explain why only a few networks have achieved the transition to permissionless operation.

**Practical Takeaways:**
- [[00:03:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=230) Takeaway: Expect Bitcoin to operate along a continuum between store of value and medium of exchange; be cautious about assuming it will instantly serve both perfectly at scale.
- [[00:04:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=290) Takeaway: The ledger-and-network combination is a core asset innovation; in practice, this suggests focusing on how value can move without traditional intermediaries, not just on preserving value.
- [[00:06:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=380) Takeaway: Corporate-chain experiments (like Libra) face governance and decentralization hurdles; anticipate similar challenges for future corporate-led projects.
- [[00:08:37]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=517) Takeaway: True permissionless networks are rare; recognize that only a few projects have managed that transition, which informs expectations about scalability and adoption.

### Libra/Lightspark background and regulatory lessons

**Key Claims + Reasoning:**
- [[00:08:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=488) Decentralization to a truly permissionless network is very hard in practice; even with early documents, market design, and strong engineering, only a few crypto networks have achieved that transition over a decade. The reasoning is that recreating a Bitcoin-like permissionless dynamic as a corporate entity is extremely hard, and corporate/affiliate structures tend to run into the same missteps (e.g., overreliance on regulatory climate) while the ecosystem as a whole is smarter than assuming regulation alone fixes everything.
- [[00:08:08]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=488) To democratize payments and related financial services (for the unbanked and unbrokered), truly permissionless networks are preferred because corporate chains struggle to maintain neutrality and scale governance in a way that broad participants will trust.
- [[00:10:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=650) The ecosystem’s intelligence and the incentives of large players make neutrality hard to sustain on corp chains; large PSPs and stable coin issuers have incentives that can undermine neutrality as networks scale.
- [[00:11:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=710) Banks recognized that centralized consortia are fragile or ineffective (despite trying for over a decade) and are now building on open chains like Ethereum; insiders from the industry view this as a land grab with a massive profitability upside if one can own the network of global payments.
- [[00:12:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=720) If a single corporate chain wins, it would amount to replacing one centralized “king” with another; there is a worry that crypto could converge similarly to other tech ecosystems unless openness persists.
- [[00:12:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=740) The timeline matters for crypto’s future: history shows mixed patterns (open vs consolidated) and it’s not predetermined; examples from broader tech history suggest openness can win in the long run, but early consolidation patterns (e.g., Visa-like consolidation) are also possible depending on how events unfold.

**Examples/Stories:**
- [[00:08:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=500) Scott Communers contributed to early clever market design and engineering aimed at opening the network. (Example of the team and effort behind attempting permissionless design.)
- [[00:08:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=530) Bitcoin as the clearest example of a permissionless genesis: the creator disappears and mining becomes its own economic phenomenon.
- [[00:10:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=650) Banks trying to form consortia for years; none of those consortia worked; today banks are on Ethereum and other chains.
- [[00:11:12]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=672) IBM’s fateful decision to gobble parts from OEMs to assemble the first PC; licensing decisions involving Microsoft.
- [[00:11:16]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=676) Open protocols (Winel) and open standards tracing back to the Silk Roads.
- [[00:11:28]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=688) The Silk Roads as an open protocol for physical commerce; historical reference to open networks.
- [[00:11:34]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=694) The internet as an open network example that contrasts with closed, centralized models.
- [[00:11:40]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=700) Shipping containers as an open standard for commerce, illustrating how open standards enable widespread adoption.
- [[00:11:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=716) Linux as a counterexample: initially seen as a toy, now core to cloud; Microsoft famously called Linux “a cancer” in the cloud era.

**Counterpoints / Nuance:**
- [[00:09:30]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=570) The ecosystem is smarter than assuming regulation alone can fix issues; there are nuanced factors beyond regulatory climate that determine outcomes.
- [[00:12:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=740) The future path of crypto could follow consolidation (as with Visa) or openness (as with some historical open protocols) depending on timelines and external developments; this is not settled and depends on how history unfolds.
- [[00:11:56]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=716) Linux’s success shows that open approaches can triumph despite initial skepticism, but it’s presented as one among several historical trajectories, not a guaranteed outcome for crypto.

**Practical Takeaways:**
- [[00:09:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=590) Favor building on truly permissionless networks when neutrality and broad participation are strategic goals; avoid overreliance on corporate-structured chains that may struggle to stay neutral.
- [[00:11:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=710) Be aware of incentives among large incumbents (banks, PSPs, stable coin issuers) to pursue consolidation or “land grabs”; design governance and interoperability to mitigate risk of capture by a single actor.
- [[00:12:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=720) Learn from open-standards history (e.g., Linux, open protocols, shipping containers, Silk Roads, the Internet) to inform architectural choices; prioritize openness and interoperable standards when seeking durable, broadly accessible systems.
- [[00:12:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=740) Monitor timelines and historical patterns of tech consolidation versus openness; plan strategies that can adapt to either trajectory rather than assuming a single outcome will dominate.

### Corp chains vs open permissionless networks

**Key Claims + Reasoning:**
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Open standards tend to win in unexpected ways; crypto is likely to follow a path similar to other open systems (e.g., the internet, shipping containers) where openness creates lasting value even if initial assessments doubt the technology. The Linux example is used to illustrate that an open, non-proprietary approach can become foundational (cloud runs on Linux, despite early doubts).
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) The arc in payments will bend toward openness, even if corp chains look compelling at the start; there are fundamental limitations to encoding universal asset parity into a corporate-chain document, and openness will win out over time.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) There may be a period of closed systems before a rebound to open networks; in the long run (about 10 years), money will move on an open network.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Regulatory clarity could unlock big, transformative (nuclear) applications that broaden competition beyond traditional systems, accelerating the shift toward open networks in payments.

**Examples/Stories:**
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Linux as the emblematic example: initially dismissed as a toy, now the cloud runs on Linux; Microsoft called Linux a cancer, yet Linux is widespread in cloud and computing infrastructure.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) The cloud today is run on Linux; 90% of the cloud runs on Linux; all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) The shipping container as an open standard for commerce, illustrating how open standards can dominate indirectly.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) The internet as an example of an open network; the Visa story is cited as a recent, relevant case demonstrating open vs. closed approaches in payments.

**Counterpoints / Nuance:**
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Corp chains might be compelling initially, but people can see through them over time; there are serious challenges in making universal asset parity and cross-asset equivalence work within a corporate-chain contract framework.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) The Visa example is “still very fresh,” implying that corporate/closed approaches may have short-term appeal but face real hurdles in achieving broad openness.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) It could be difficult to sustain an open-money system in the face of incumbent resistance; a future stage of closed systems could emerge before another push toward openness.

**Practical Takeaways:**
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Design and invest with openness in mind: aim for interoperable, open networks where every asset can be treated as a class of equals; plan for a long-term shift toward open networks in payments.
- [[00:12:23]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=743) Use the Linux/open-standards playbook as a blueprint for crypto: expect “unexpected wins” and build for flexibility, robustness, and broad adoption rather than locking into a closed silo.
- [[00:16:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=979) Be prepared for regulatory clarity to unlock major, high-impact use cases (nuclear apps) that accelerate the move toward open networks in payments.
- [0x??] If you’re designing crypto/payment systems today, anticipate a multi-year arc of development where initial closedness may give way to openness; stay adaptable to the potential cycle of closed → open.

**Rapid-fire / practical personal takeaways mentioned in segment:**
- [[00:14:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=890) Productivity hack: triage inbox with a layered task list and use emoji (e.g., red alert, pause button, Siren) to indicate urgency.
- [[00:14:50]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=890) Reading suggestion: If anyone builds it, everyone dies (AI doomsday thought experiment) as a useful lens for thinking about AI race dynamics.
- [[00:15:20]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=920) Founders’ advice: often best to ignore incumbents’ guidance because rapid change across domains makes their traditional playbooks less reliable.
- [[00:16:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=960) The core belief about AI: even if progress stops today, the AI impact on the economy will be transformational.

**Additional notes tied to segment context:**
- [[00:16:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=979) Core closing takeaway: if you ask the speaker, money will move on an open network within about ten years, despite potential cycles of closed systems in between. This reinforces the practical expectation to align strategies with openness and interoperability.

- [[00:16:19]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=979) The speaker confirms Linux as the key analogy: a historically open, decentralized technology that ended up dominating modern computing infrastructure, despite early skepticism. This reinforces the broader argument that crypto/open networks may achieve outsized, unexpected adoption.

### Open standards and Linux analogy for openness in crypto

**Key Claims + Reasoning:**
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) Claim: It's often good to ignore the advice of the incumbent layer.  
  Reasoning: Not explicitly stated in this segment.
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) Claim: The impact of AI will be massive even if we freeze the models today; even if progress stops, the economy will be transformational.  
  Reasoning: The speaker asserts that the impact on the economy will be transformational, indicating a fundamental and large-scale effect regardless of continued progress.

**Examples/Stories:**
- [[00:15:45]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdC0_cHqdvM&t=945) Example described: The question “what is the smallest hill that you would die on?” used to probe how strongly someone holds a position.

## Actionable Frameworks / Checklists

### Neutral Network Governance Framework [00:03:50-00:08:47]

1. It has to be a network that's truly neutral.
2. It has a track record of governance.
3. It has decentralization.

### Asset Continuum Framework [00:03:50-00:08:47]

1. Each asset is on a continuum between store of value and a pure medium of exchange.
2. Gold is an example of a dual-role asset: a store of value and, in a crisis, a potential medium of exchange (though impractical in practice).
3. Most assets start as a store of value and then become a medium of exchange (historically, paper credentials evolved into a medium of exchange).
4. Bitcoin introduces ledger innovation: the ability to write and read from a global ledger without intermediaries.
5. Bitcoin is also a network for transferring value seamlessly without relying on intermediaries.
6. Stable coins reinforce the dollar as the global reserve and serve as a distribution channel for those who lack access to traditional banking.
