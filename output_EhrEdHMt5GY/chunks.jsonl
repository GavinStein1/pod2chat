You know, it's a good question. I mean, in web in general,\nthere are so many different things you can choose from now, you know, like what languages like,\nam I going to go react and then am I going to go next year\nor remakes? I'm just going to go vanilla JavaScript. It's too much. It's it's too much. Yeah. I mean personally\nwhat I would definitely do is like, as I've always done, just go first into\nthe fundamentals of JavaScript itself, because that's still like the main web\nlanguage, of course. And then see what like\nand then just dependent based on the product\nthat you want to build. Because I feel like a lot of people are kind of moving\nto trend driven development, right. Like they just choose whatever's popular. And that's also nice\nbecause a lot of content creation is then around those languages\nor those tools. So you get a lot\nof, ideas and help with that.

Yeah, I shared that a lot on Twitter\nand on medium and on Instagram, and then people liked it\nand I was like, okay, perfect. Because like, apparently I'm not the only weird one that tries\nto approach things that you should not, you know. Yeah. And that felt good. But yeah, so I like I only wrote about the stuff\nthat I dealt with during my daily job, and that was great because it was kind of my, like, writing\nand creating those things was kind of my, yeah. Like my free time. Like,\nI could relax. I could kind of at the end of the day,\nI could organize it in my head by writing about it\nand by like, kind of. Yeah, like answering the questions\nthat I had during the day. And yeah, that kind of progressed. And then I got into like I did that\nfull time then eventually back in 2021.

But if you're just like, well,\nI saw it on Twitter and a lot of people are using it and there's a lot of community support\nthat's not going to win over many people. And also in a lot of cases, it might be cheaper\nto just self-hosted, but then you need to know the risks, like,\nokay, well, DDoS attacks, all these things. Like you need to understand what are the potential risks to hosting\nand to web development in general. You know, like, what are these hosting\nproviders maybe helping me with it? I would otherwise have to set up myself. Like, to me, it's just so obvious. Like, first just try it yourself. Like, you're not stupid. You can do it like it's. It's difficult,\nbut challenge yourself like it's. That's fun. And sure, your initial approach\nmay not be great, but that's. Yeah, you learn from it. And only then.

My name is Patrick Akil and\nif you're interested in the tech trends nowadays, specifically in web development,\nthis episode is for you. Joining me today is Lydia Hallie. Software engineer. And I love her drive and curiosity,\nfiguring out all the fundamentals and using that as an educator\nto educate others. We cover that, developer advocacy,\nAI in education, and much, much more. Enjoy beyond coding. What do you think nowadays for people\nthat, like, come into either web development\nor tech as a whole? What is like the biggest bottleneck\nyou think, or how would you start? You know, it's a good question. I mean, in web in general,\nthere are so many different things you can choose from now, you know, like what languages like,\nam I going to go react and then am I going to go next year\nor remakes? I'm just going to go vanilla JavaScript. It's too much. It's it's too much. Yeah. I mean personally\nwhat I would definitely do is like, as I've always done, just go first into\nthe fundamentals of JavaScript itself, because that's still like the main web\nlanguage, of course. And then see what like\nand then just dependent based on the product\nthat you want to build. Because I feel like a lot of people are kind of moving\nto trend driven development, right. Like they just choose whatever's popular. And that's also nice\nbecause a lot of content creation is then around those languages\nor those tools. So you get a lot\nof, ideas and help with that. But I feel like especially when you're just beginning,\nyou need to understand what the, I guess constraints are\nand what like the difficulties are with what you're working with. So I honestly,\nI would just go like vanilla JavaScript or like choose a framework\nthat's like as vanilla as possible and only then you kind of work\nyour way up to like react and then Next.js and then server\ncomponents, all that stuff. Yeah. But it's difficult\nbecause I always get asked questions from beginners, like where,\nwhere do I begin? There's so many things I'm like, honestly,\nI don't know, like I had it kind of easy back in 2015\nwhen I started that. Yeah. It's difficult. I've never heard the term\ntrend driven development, but I like it. I think it's a good term. Yeah. So it's and it's definitely something\nI see have it in practice as well. Like I'm,\nI'm on a lot of Reddit to be honest. I learned a lot.\nI don't really discuss a lot. Not read it. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Cause\nyou shouldn't do that for your comments. Well, I love it. I mean,\nI give it compound to certain topics. It's like it's one of them. Yeah. And I still see questions\nfirst of all on job hopping. But second of all, with AI, is it\nstill feasible to come into this domain. And I see two camps, people that are just genuinely interested, that really want it,\nlike do it from ground up, have either a traditional career path or\neducational path, or just out of interest. And the other campus just kind of make\na boatload of money, basically. Yeah. And, I don't think that's helpful. No, no, I fully agree. I feel like and it's such a shame. I often see that also on my Twitter, and I just really miss the time\nwhen people were actually, like, interested in what they're doing. Like, I'm always like it. It's great. The tech makes so much money. I'm like, we're definitely very privileged\nthat we're interested in a field that is so, like lucrative\nand so fun and like, we get to be so entrepreneurial\nwith everything. But I just miss, like that. People are genuinely interested\nin what they're doing and curious, like, I, I it's so easy to build a product\nnow with AI and just get something out real quick\nor copy what other people are doing. Yeah, but it just to me it lacks\nso much like soul, like so much emotion. Like I just see the same content\nevery time. And I'm like, if this is where the internet is going\nand like where websites and ideas are going, it's such like a,\nI don't know, very harmful trend. It is. Yeah.

And I just truly wish that more people so younger\npeople were truly like curious again. And like, all right. So I have this issue where I'm working with this tool\nor I'm working within a browser, what is it that I'm actually working with\nor like, you know, JavaScript does it. And I'm just saying JavaScript now as a, as an example\nthat whatever you're working with, like it interacts with these features or\nwith those features, how does it do that? And like how is that implemented? And what did the creators think\nwhen they implemented that like, well, why is it there in the first place? Yeah, at least that's\nhow I personally think about everything. And maybe it's not like I'm\nsure it's not the most, not the most useful, but of course, it's\nnot how you make the most money the quickest if you just kind of take\nthe long route, like really researching something first and like going,\ntrying to understand the fundamentals. But I still think it's\nworth it in the long run to like, really become an expert in that field. And then based on that, you can also,\nyou know, if you're if you want to use AI, you can definitely improve your\nyour prompts based on what you know. You know what to avoid in your prompt. You know what specifics to ask for. What I might have to avoid,\nlike building within your app. Yeah. So yeah, it's, I really hope\nthat more people I don't know. Yeah, it's. And not to be pessimistic, but like,\nI just like to say that's how I personally am. And every time I see that\nor like younger people that are just like,\noh yeah, I created this app or this website\nwithin ten minutes and like, sure. But like, how long will it live? Like,\ncan you maintain it? Do you know what it does? Do you know the security vulnerability is and I'm starting\nto sound like a boomer now. That's like super negative. But yeah, no, but it's just true. And of course, like,\nthat's just the current state of AI. I'm sure that even maybe within two years\nfrom now, that's not even an issue like it's been improved so much already\nthat you don't have to like it's, you know, secure and everything. I would love to see some research\nfor people that, like, have either behavior or motivation\nfor why they're in this field. Because also from this Reddit perspective,\nI see a lot of people that are genuinely not happy\nwith their job. Like, I also have friends\nthat don't really do hands on tech work, but maybe are in the tech field,\nor like either in sales and still in tech companies\nor tech is like the core. Yeah, and not everyone is as happy,\nwhich is also. Yeah, I don't know,\nmaybe that's me specifically. Like I like being happy with what I do\nand not everyone needs to have that. But I do think it's a sad,\nsad trend, to be honest. Yeah, I think eventually, especially with the comfort\nyou get within tech, is, you know, you can kind of work from home or like\nwe don't have a very like physical job. It's absolutely it's selling. So you kind of just get comfortable. It's like, you know, I'm unhappy. But I have all this\nlike I have this salary. I have, you know, this comfort\nand you kind of and I noticed\nI started being like that as well. And I was like, no, like, I need to\nmake sure that what I'm doing right now is truly what is best for my life\nand like where I want to be in life and my current kind of stage in life,\nI guess, like, I don't want to just end up stuck at a job that I am not\nreally interested in, but like, of course it pays\nwell and I has all these benefits. But then, you know,\nyou become a risk averse kind of. And I just coast. Yeah. Exactly.\nYeah. And I don't like that. I think people waste a lot of their lives\naway just kind of being, comfortable. And it's not because I think\na lot of people maybe get into tech with a good idea and like, with good intentions,\nand they're like, you know, I want to, like, actually build something and like, contribute\nsomething to the future. Yeah. But then eventually kind of\nas there in these maybe bigger organizations\nthat kind of just slowly, slowly dims. But maybe it's just human progression that some organizations\nalso want you to coast. Like if there's not really a career progression\npath or people don't get promoted, that basically means that, yeah,\nthe company is fine with you coasting. They want you to be in that position.

I can afford not to coast because\nI don't have any serious responsibilities. No kids, no house. Even. I love the flexibility. Yeah. That also means I can take more risk,\nwhich is fun. Like you can reap\nthe rewards of those risks. And when the risks. I mean, when they hit you\nback, it's not as hard as other hit. Yeah, exactly.\nYeah. I'm in the exact same boat. That's also like I think your younger\nyears, you should kind of spend just really trying many different things\nand being more like risky in that way, try to do the things that may feel wrong\nor feel like, oh, I'm just scared. Like,\njust get getting out of your comfort zone. And then when you're older yet like when you have kids\nor any of the house, when you have all these other responsibilities,\nI feel like it's of course good to maybe join a, not necessarily\njoin a bigger organization, but like, totally understand why you might\nprioritize, you know, like your family and all these responsibilities\nmaybe above pure happiness. Yeah. I mean, preferably they're combined,\nbut I feel like for that's often difficult to find. But yeah, like, I like seeing younger\npeople at these, like, bigger companies. Of course. Like, I think it's amazing. Like, I'm sure that the experience\nthey get is great, but at the same time,\nI also see that you like, you become less entrepreneurial, I guess, like you don't\ndare to take as many more stability. Yeah. And, at the same time,\nthat's amazing. But I feel like, I don't know,\nI wish that more people really thought about, like, their own potential\nand their own life path and really kind of reflect, like, okay,\nam I truly happy or am I just following someone else's\ndream? Kind of. Because especially in tech, I feel like a lot of people\nkind of tend to want the same thing. And I'm like, surely not\neveryone can really think this way? Like, this is too, too much of the same\ntype of dream, the same type of life. What same thing do you do?\nYou mean when you say that? Well, it's more like\njust grinding nonstop to get a business. Maybe in crypto or in AI right now, and then, you know, like sell it to either\na company or going to like an IPO. Yeah, for the IPO. And it's and it's great. Like a\nthat's a great goal. But I, I notice\nthat it's not for everyone. And then you often meet these founders or\nthe people that work at these companies. And they're just like so unhappy\nand like they're so unhealthy too. And you can just see that\nthey're not really following, like what their soul wants. Some of that makes sense. Yeah. So it's also really difficult\nto really like not I don't know if it has something\nto do with comparison or, just. Yeah, not not like trusting yourself. I'm not sure. Yeah. But again, like, it's no criticism\nto anyone, but I feel like it's, it's important\nthat people really meet themselves too. And you can always combine tech with stuff\nthat you're actually interested in. Don't just try to be one of one\nof the many people that try to make it. And I, I wonder if because there is a\ntrend towards more people burning out. Yeah. And I wonder\nif this is a factor in that. Right. If you don't get fulfillment out\nof the work that you do day in, day out. Yeah. And if you have an unhealthy relationship and you work more than you're supposed\nto, let's say over and over again, I can see people trending towards\nburnout, right? Where you just get sick\nof what you're doing, basically. And your body actually hits you\nback, basically. Yeah, yeah. Mentally you're still fine,\nbut then physically you can't do anything or even the reverse. Yeah, I've never been into a burnout, but I do see this epidemic of people\nthat just, I don't know, get burnt out. Yeah. It's very alarming. Yeah.

I think it's it's difficult to learn\nhow to avoid a burnout. But yeah, it's it's so important I agree. Yeah. I'm very curious recently\nfrom your perspective of developer advocate or developer\nrelations, because I have a friend who's a colleague I've known him for,\noh, close to two months. No, close to two years. Two months\nwould have been, like quite short. But in any case, he joined this company and he was always creating videos\nabout specific technology, and that was something\nhe did in his personal time. But in his free time, he was\nreally enthusiastic about this technology, even though he had never used it\nin production for business specifically. I don't I also don't think it matters. But in the end, that company\neventually reached out to him and said, do you want to work for us? Right. The things that you do,\nwe would love for you to do more of. So he basically got his dream job,\nsomething that he was doing in his free time.\nHe now gets to do full time. Yeah, he hasn't done so yet. But I do feel like for me, career\npath wise, developer advocacy seems very interesting. And I also think that as people\nget more productive with technologies, developers\nare always going to become an audience. So a person that is responsible\nalso educating developers in that aspect\ncan be very interesting as a career path. But for me,\nI have no clue what you do day to day. I talk to him and I'm like, are you going\nto create videos all day long? And he's like, I talk to people. Some people, that's what they do. I say like understanding engineer. More like\nor is he an actual like now he is. But his title is going to become\ndeveloper advocate civically. But it's like the most vague job\nthat you can have. Like, yeah, if my previous job ever. So I was\nthen also like developer advocate, but like my whole team consisted of people\nthat did so many different things, like we were a team,\nbut we kind of weren't because everyone, which is doing something\ncompletely different. Okay. You know, like some people worked on\ndocumentation, others worked on organizing meetups\nand others created videos. Others were on Twitter like,\nyou know, it's it's so broad. So, yeah, the term like whenever people\nsay, I'm a developer advocate, like I, you need to be more\nspecific. Like, yes, exactly. Yeah, I know personally kind of how\nI also kind of got into into that. So I first started as a full time\nsoftware engineering, and in my free time I made, kind of content on the stuff\nthat I dealt with on a daily basis that I felt like\nwasn't talked about enough. I mean, it was talked about enough,\nbut it was written or documented in a way that just didn't really fit with my, like,\nhow I learn things. Or like, I guess every time I work\nwith a technology or anything in life, really, I just create this\nreally weird visual picture in my head. It's it's difficult to explain,\nbut I think I learned stuff slightly different than most people. Yeah. So I wanted to almost recreate that. And then. Yeah, I shared that a lot on Twitter\nand on medium and on Instagram, and then people liked it\nand I was like, okay, perfect. Because like, apparently I'm not the only weird one that tries\nto approach things that you should not, you know. Yeah. And that felt good.", "segment_ids": [246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334]}, {"chunk_id": "coarse-0004-00:14:17", "tier": "coarse", "start": 857.92, "end": 1103.76, "text": "Or like, I guess every time I work\nwith a technology or anything in life, really, I just create this\nreally weird visual picture in my head.

Yeah, like answering the questions\nthat I had during the day. And yeah, that kind of progressed. And then I got into like I did that\nfull time then eventually back in 2021. But what I found the most difficult is that I had to be in creative\nmode like full time. And I couldn't do that because, like,\nI'm not a very creative person. Like I'm definitely more logical. So like, I like creating content like the what I'm doing now, like educating\nin my free time, like next to engineering, because otherwise I get no inspiration\nand I, I kind of burn out. Well, not fully, of course,\nbut like, I'm starting to burn out. If I have to be in this creative mode,\nyou lose the passion. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of people\nthat want to get into developer advocacy,\nyou need to kind of understand that, okay? Make sure that you can also still do\na lot of engineering on the side if that was your full time job previously,\nbecause it's for at least personally, like I can only of course\nspeak from personal experience, but I found the creative work\nso much more difficult than engineering. Like, I'd much rather just kind of be\nin my comfort zone in my code base than having to, like, write stuff\nin a certain way that need that everyone needs to understand, that needs to be\ntechnically accurate, that needs to flow. Well, I don't know, like, yeah,\nyou need to be a specific type of person to be better at developer advocacy\nthan engineering. But like, of course, like, just, again,\ntake the risks, like, do it, see if it fits and then,\nyeah, see what happens. But personally, I found it\nway more difficult to do. I can see that. I can say, like,\nI'm going to give it training soon. And so the content of that, I know it because I've done it before,\nI've done it last year and the year before that. But this year\nI try to kind of a new career path, like I'm a CB as a consultancy,\nas a consultant, I now I'm a product manager role since January, so I haven't actually done\na lot of hands on work. And then I'm like, man,\nif I give this training right now, it's fine because I feel like\nI know a lot of the internals. I look about what is new,\nI'll update the material, but if it's going to be in a year or two\nand I still am in this product manager role,\nI feel like I'm going to be like a fraud. Like, I haven't worked\nwith this in production for so long, and then I do educate others\nand that feels kind of odd to me. Yeah. So also from your perspective, then\nif you're full time only creating content about material on what people should use,\nmaybe in production or in a project, and you don't actually do that\nwith engineering experience yourself, I could see that you burn out from that perspective\nand also just creatively, at some point your mind is blank,\nlike you need new inspiration. Yeah, no, but that is exactly that. And I felt so bad sometimes because like,\nI spoke at conferences or something and people would come to me and ask\nquestions about what I was talking about. I'm like, truly, I don't know,\nbecause like, I haven't worked with it in like a product or like a production\nenvironment in like a year and everything move so fast within that\ntechnology that I couldn't help them. Even though I was talking about it. I was like, this feels strange. Like I should understand better what I'm talking about. And like, if this was my own content,\nI would have never dare to do that because, like, I always want to make sure\nthat whatever I'm saying is 100% true and like it's from my own,\nlike, experience.

So then you are confused,\nbut then you think you get it, but actually you're still confused because you still don't really get it\nbecause people explain it the wrong way, and then those people share\ntheir experiences the wrong way because they understood it\nthe wrong way. Like, I don't know, you kind of built\nthis big misunderstanding. Yes, exactly. So to me, I like with I mean, I don't have a big following,\nbut a decent one, and I feel like it's a big responsibility\nto make sure that I don't contribute to any, like, confusion or that at least\nI can be some source of truth. That's not like a specification\nor the official documentation. Just. And I can only base it on like my own frustration that I\nsometimes feel with certain content. And also, I think everyone approaches\nthis differently, but personally, what I really like to do\nis go into the deepest details possible, like just go as in-depth as I can\nwhenever I learn something new, and then after I know the actual\nfundamentals, I can then simplify it. But if I read someone else's\nsimplification, you know that has already gone through their\nown brain processes that are, you know, like they have their own filters\nand their own, like, I don't know, emotional state attached\nto it that might not align with mine. So it's not accurate. Sorry. I have a really hard time\nlike phrasing this. Yeah. It's already distilled content. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And, yeah, that's why I feel like it's so important\nthat people are a bit more curious and do more research, because I feel like\neveryone can definitely get to that stage with like,\nokay, understand the real fundamentals. So then try to simplify it. And that's also a skill\nthat you got to learn. But when you can really explain a topic\nwell, you know like explain it like I'm five\nbut it's also technically accurate.

But yeah, it's so yeah, it's very trippy\nbecause now, yeah, you have a big group of people that are convinced\nit works a certain way when it doesn't. And yeah, try to convince people that\nAI is wrong and then that you're right. It's Yeah, it's difficult. I think high quality content always wins. But then it's the question of visibility,\nright? How do you get the the people\nor the people that need to find that education towards the quality\nthat is, in the end, factually accurate? We have the documentation of the people\nthat create certain technologies. But even then, I mean, it's\nfirst line of education, I would say, but it doesn't work for everyone. Yeah. So then people pick up on the and create,\nI say, distilled content specifically for either what they would want in an educational path\nor what they think an audience would want. Yeah. And then that gets distilled. And if we then also have an AI layer on top of that,\nit's even more distilled content, like, I don't know how to fix this,\nbut I also don't want to say, don't use AI because it it will accelerate\nyour learning if it is factually accurate. Yeah. I mean, now it's sometimes helps\nwhen I just say like add your source and then I see the sources and I'm like,\noh, this is just from someone's medium blog for ten years ago. Like,\nthat's not a good source. So now especially with JavaScript\nor anything web development, I'm always just use the HTML spec\nor the JavaScript spec, or like the W3C group\nthat makes all these web API so that it can only use\nthe actual specification. And even then it's sometimes still\nI guess it's called hallucination or no, like loose. Announcer. But like it's. Yeah, again, it's easier\nto know what you add or what to ask for if you know what components\ngo into something. Like if I'm asking about a promise\nexecution, I don't know, in JavaScript. Like I need to understand that it needs\nto add something about the task user or the promise job to you. Or like all these, you know, the then\nhandlers are a promise object internally. Because otherwise it might just\nit always oversimplifies it. Like never asks like imagine\nyou have a stack of pancakes and then like a promise is like the sirup. I'm like, dude, no, like,\nI know what's going on. I don't want to do this. It always does that. So, like, yeah, you need to, yeah, I think, I guess it's called, like,\nprompt engineering. Like, you can become a better\nprompt engineer when you know a technology really well or like\na specific part of your field really well. In our case, technology,\nbut sounds for everyone. And you know what's to ask. Better\ndon't explain it with pancake terminology, because I always have to be like,\ndon't use analogies. Don't pretend like I'm a child. Like aim it at like expert developers. Yeah, you need to be so specific\nto not dumb it down. Yeah, yeah. Interesting. We started this episode with okay,\nhow would I start if I'm either new in the field\nand you mentioned fundamentals of JavaScript in one of them,\nto start off, which I agree with. And it's something\nI probably underestimated myself. I jumped right into react. I want it to be productive,\nbe practical, get stuff done.

And then when I was less effective, well,\nI thought I should be effective. That's when I was like,\nokay, something's wrong. And I stepped back and I looked and and educated myself\non fundamentals more and more. Yeah,\nbut this trend of frameworks and people creating their own frameworks, and I think\nwe we have quite a lot of technology. If you jump in web development nowadays,\neven on the back end. Now I saw Deno 2.0. We have fun. We have node and they all are on this kind\nof competition spectrum with each other. Yeah, introducing new features. And I think it's a good thing.\nI think it's a healthy thing. Competition breeds success\nat the end of the day. But the companies also need to make money. So at the end of the day, they have\ntheir own kind of business system and they might host a certain solution\non the cloud for you. And that's what you then pay for. Yeah. I don't know if we need all of that,\nto be honest. Like I can do a lot\nwith just vanilla JavaScript. Yeah. And I'm curious from your perspective,\nlike, do we need all these solutions? We have a lot of them and they are there for people to make money,\nbut also they alleviate some problems. Not all though. Well, need is a bad word, I think. I mean, they definitely make things easier\nfor a lot of people. But I again,\nespecially with like stuff like hosting, I mean, I often use\nreseller stuff for hosting, but I also understand how I would set\nthis up myself in Cloudflare or in AWS. Like that's also what I worked\nwith many years in, like DevOps. So I feel like before\nI get into hosting, understand or not even hosting also with like bun\nand and all these runtimes. Yeah. Understand\nthe issue that they're trying to solve. Why do we have runtimes.\nWhat do runtimes do. What does Bunn have that Deno\nor note doesn't and vice versa. And also with hosting like\nwhy would I use reseller Netlify or go straight to Cloudflare AWS like again\nbe curious. Like what are the problems\nthat they're solving? What is their solution?\nWhat is their roadmap? What's their pricing? All these things and yeah, definitely\nfirst try to just set it up yourself. You don't have to go\nto production with it, but then you definitely understand\nwhat goes into a hosting provider, just as an example. Yeah. Because then you can like also like when you're starting to\nor when you're part of a company, you need to like kind of\nconvince your manager to maybe, you know, use certain tools or,\nyou know, take certain approaches and you need to be able\nto kind of explain yourself. But if you're just like, well,\nI saw it on Twitter and a lot of people are using it and there's a lot of community support\nthat's not going to win over many people. And also in a lot of cases, it might be cheaper\nto just self-hosted, but then you need to know the risks, like,\nokay, well, DDoS attacks, all these things. Like you need to understand what are the potential risks to hosting\nand to web development in general. You know, like, what are these hosting\nproviders maybe helping me with it? I would otherwise have to set up myself. Like, to me, it's just so obvious. Like, first just try it yourself. Like, you're not stupid. You can do it like it's. It's difficult,\nbut challenge yourself like it's. That's fun. And sure, your initial approach\nmay not be great, but that's. Yeah, you learn from it. And only then. And also like you need to suffer first\nbefore you can truly appreciate like what other people have done for you. And so I like I'm like,\nthank God ever so exists. Or like all these other hosting providers exist because otherwise\nyou just take it for granted. And then like if some if one of these providers goes out\nand you're just, you know, you have a 500 every time because they get attacked\nor whatever, and you're just stuck.

It might not always be possible. I love this notion of you have to suffer\nfirst to appreciate what? What like, isn't it? It's true, though it'd be hilarious\nif you get, like, a cloud course and they're like,\nokay, let's start with the fundamentals. You have this piece of metal,\nyou installed this offer. I would love that. Yeah, I would love like a course it goes\ninto like server architecture, hard work. Like I want to go to the actual\nlike electron level. Like how does memory work, you know,\nand then we go all the way up from there. But I'm the opposite. Like I do want to be effective,\nbut then at some point it becomes a problem because as you say,\nlike if I have to take control, I have to take control.\nAnd then all those UN security insecurities and uncertainties\ncome with it.

I don't think I have to. I do think it would be helpful\nfrom a knowledge perspective, but from a curiosity standpoint, I don't\nhave that for that specific technology. Yeah, I have it for other things, and if I were to have it for everything,\nI don't think I would get anything done because we have quite a broad like\nlandscape of things you can go deep in. Yeah. And then it's\na matter of picking your poison, I guess. Like which one do you want to focus on and which one\ndo you want to take ownership of? That's also what I like, though,\nbecause we have a lot of different people that get enthusiastic\nabout a lot of different things. Yeah,\nand that's why I love this tech field. People can go anywhere, right? If you're sick of software engineering, you might become a developer\nadvocate, right? You might be really enthusiastic\nabout education or the people aspect\nmight just really, really suit you. And then you become a people manager\nfrom an engineering perspective. Yeah, you can leverage whatever knowledge\nyou have in a specific domain. Take that with you to the next domain. But for me, indeed, like you mentioned,\ncuriosity and drive and passion, that should be at the forefront. And that can always change. Yeah, but as long as you have that,\nthen you're fine in this field. If you don't have that, I don't think\nyou're going to survive, to be honest. No, no. Or like. Well, yeah. Or unless you're maybe part\nof a bigger company. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But I\nfeel like that's not a fun way to live. Like, it's just part of,\nlike, being a human to be curious. And I feel like once that dies, you know, that you've done something wrong,\nbut it's still fixable. But, like, try to try to avoid that. Do you see yourself kind of on this path\nof educating others in the future as well, or what like interests you,\nwhich you've never tried? Yeah, I'm having like a quarter\nlife crisis right now. I don't know, do you like I'm 26 now\nand it's like, okay, okay, 30s are coming. I guess that's a proper quarter life.\nYeah, yeah. So hopefully, maybe it's my midlife. I know, who knows, but, Yeah. No, I don't know. Like, it's still my passion is still in\nsoftware engineering I love that it's my my safe space is in the IDE. But I get the most\nI get satisfaction out of helping people. Like, it's after\nI've felt like I've helped people. I can, like, go to bed, feel like, okay, I've done something today,\nand I don't always get that with, like, software engineering alone. Maybe unless I work on a project\nthat I truly believe in. So maybe I just need to find that, like, I just really want to focus on stuff\nthat is like, actually cool. That actually interests me. But in the meantime, yeah, I love to help\npeople out, but it's difficult, as I said, to do that full time\nbecause I would have to be kind of in that creative mind full time.

Well,\nwhat do you think? You might enjoy it.\nLike I love doing podcasting. I love creating videos. I love creating educational content. But like for what? Like what do you get from it? Or like,\nwhat do you think people get from it? Like, what's the reason that you enjoy it? I don't know, I just I think it's\nin the same line as what you mentioned. It's helping people, right? Either with specific moments. Yeah. Or you phrase it in a way. You communicate\nin a way that it just clicks. Because I feel like everyone\nlearns in a different way. And you might see similarities,\nbut there's still specifics there. Yeah. The way you explain it or the way you communicate things with the insights\nthat you can bring, can be very valuable. And insights are not just the only thing\nright. You have to communicate it\nproperly as well. Yeah, that I really enjoy those moments.

Otherwise\nit's like a regret. But now it's really,\nI think what you mentioned as well. Right now I'm, I'm not coasting. But it is comfort, right. Because I can do everything\nif I don't want to be a product manager in the next assignment,\nI can try out something else. And it's still kind of a safe space.
