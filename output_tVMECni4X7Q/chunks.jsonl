designers use to build complex websites website that they chart four and five figures for these days the amount of tools to build websites is overwhelming and some of these tools are actually quite easy to learn tools like Wix and Squarespace however they are easy to learn because they make the process a little bit too simplistic and that leaves you with a generic website definitely not something that you can use on complex interesting projects the tools that I'm going to be using in this video are reloom which will use to plan out the content turn it into wireframe and even select the look and feel for the website then we're going to export this into webflow where we will build all of the additional functionality add interactions make sure the website is responsive and publish the website now some of you might mention that also has their own AI side Builder and if we're just going to get started in weow that's going to be easier and it is however just like I said about Wix and Squarespace I feel like we're going to end up with a two shallow of a template now I personally think that using reum to plan out the content and wireframing is a crucial step and that's actually

what's happening so you can see for the homepage it already created the different sections in what kind of content we're going to have on each section and then it also suggested additional Pages

doubleclick this and we can uh change the text if it doesn't work for us but it already gave us a really you know a great place to start with and this saves so much time so it gave us the whole page here and again this is just the beginning now I can click each one of these components for example the navigation and you can see I have here replace component so now real is going to suggest me a lot of different layouts and options for the text we can have the logo in the center we can have the logo on the left side we can have the uh you know the navigation centered or it can be right aligned

first of all we've got the color scheme and then we've got the typography and a little bit of UI style so for the colors the first thing we can do is just Shuffle and just experiment with different palettes but I want to tell you the truth I'm just looking at how this looks like three colors plus Black and Whites for a wedding photography he feels like too much a little bit so the first thing I want to do is I'm just going to get rid of them I just want like very clean maybe just like with one color um and let's see how that would look like so I'm just generating random colors now I have

basically gives me different variations of this color palette so I can have this one as white this one as a little bit of a pale maybe this one let's make this one darker maybe the dark blue yeah this is actually pretty solid this can be white actually I'm happy with with how this maybe this will do this like a light light blue okay so now this actually feels pretty good I'm not sure about the color I can go ahead and Shuffle up a few more times I do feel like it's nice that it's kind of like subtle and because the images have a lot of green in them actually here this greenish tone actually not bad and if I want to refine this even further I can click on the but the color itself and then maybe take it to a little bit more greenish like this okay so this feels much better to me so again I

good now I also have this small normal so let's experiment with this small text large regular large text actually looking at this right now I actually like the large one best although I don't like that we have a single word here so I might change the text a little bit later but in terms of design I actually like the large the large one best in terms of weight I can make this I guess Bolder but I actually like the way that it is here and we also have a style like can space out the letters we can make it uppercase oo this actually looks nice uppercase so let's go with this so I'm going to stay with this yeah type looks much nicer now so I I'm liking this um let's see what else do I have here so we've got the buttons whether I want buttons to be like with an outline with kind of like a shady um what is slick slick let's go with slick rather than elevated no I'm just going to go with a slick card and images oh we also have by the way the round corners so you can see here we've got a

design and then going with it they always explore multiple ideas also a lot of times they like to show clients multiple different ideas to pick from so right now we've got this and this is concept number one and you can see here I can pitch Concepts and I can review or compare a few different concepts so let's go here and let's actually go ahead and create a new concept so let's try something else just to see you know if we can get something even better and I'm going to have to upload the images again which is a little bit tedious okay so let's just choose something else just so that we can yeah maybe it looks a little bit different right so I'm just going to do that uh let's replace the photos here as well and see what we're getting this one we had already Okay so this time let's try to do something with a little bit more colors right the previous palette was just like a single color palette let's see what we can do with something else I still feel like we need this to be like

do this darker or something yeah okay now I feel like we've got enough contrast and interest as we're scrolling in here in terms of typography maybe we do want to have like a different concept here let's see what we have under display display is fonts that look nicer when they're big maybe something like this a real fat face let's see if we can have something a little bit more interesting here

to export our website into webflow the first thing we need to do is to clone the reom starter file now I just want to say a quick word about web flow web flow is a super super powerful tool and it does have a little bit of a learning cve that's why we have a lot of video tutorials on uh web flow we even have a full-on course on web flow however what I'm going to demonstrate right now requires almost zero understanding in webflow so you'll be able to follow along even if you have no background in web flow so fear nothing right so this starter guide from reloom Al includes a style guide that is BAS basically has all of the styles that we have created here in this style guide so relim is basically going to import everything here and then also the content itself now the way that we're going to do this is we can open up here the webflow apps and we can search for reloom and then we can go ahead and install it on this website now once that is happening we will be able to see the website we've been working on so Miki and Nom's wedding and I'm going to click this and I will be able to see all of the different concepts right so we have concept one and concept two what I want to do is

so I'm going to start import and this is going to take a few minutes to bring in all of the content into webflow a few moments later B bam so the import has finish and this took a couple of minutes but it did save us 4 hours because basically usually takes about 30 minutes to build each section and I can attest that this is true this is really really a huge timesaver so now that we've got the whole website inside of webflow let's see what it takes to really bring this website to conclusion to make sure that it's all functional and working so let's start from the top and we've got this navigation we've got this logo here so let's double click this now this is you can see this is a a green instance because this is a component I'm not going to get into as I said Deep Web flow stuff so

like yeah it's yeah looks like part of the website for now okay next I want to make sure that these buttons actually work so I want the story button to take us to the story section event details

is this one let's call this section RSVP so now these sections have different ideas and I can go through here and I can edit the links so I'm clicking this and under the settings here you can see

thing we wanted to do is to replace these icons okay so where are we going to get icons I'm going to go to Icon finder that's my favorite place to get free icons super fast so we can go here and uh

date let's also look for the other one so we've got location and dress code so location let's look for location let's see what we have um this one looks good to me so I'm going to choose this one and

well but you've basically seen how I've did that before so it's more interesting to me to add a little bit of interactions to the website right now so let's let's make this a little bit more like sexy where things like fade in as we're loading and and stuff like this so the first thing I want to do is maybe pick this uh this whole text area now basically I can select just you know this heading or this or the button but you can see that they are grouped together inside of this it's called Max with large that's basically the the style or basically this whole thing here is grouping the whole text

thing here is grouping the whole text together so let's animate this here under the interactions I can go ahead ahead and create an element Trigger or a page trigger basically we want when the page is loading or basically this gets into the view we want this to fade in so let's add something like scroll into view now this is actually not going to scroll into view because it's just going to be here when we're loading but that's what we want to do right now and what we can do when it's scrolling into the view we can either create a custom animation we've got a lot of very cool pre um you know readymade animation for us in this case let's choose the slide and you can preview this is how it's going to animate from the left let's choose from the bottom yeah this is nice okay so I'm happy with this and I also want to animate maybe this header image here I'm going to do the same but I want first the text and then the image so let's add another scroll into view to this slide from the bottom but for this I'm going to add like a 300 milliseconds delay to this let's see what happens now if I preview so now you can see that we've got the text sliding in and then the image sliding in and that's nice right that gives like a nice feel when we're loading this website and we can go ahead and add more stuff for example here let's let's make them trigger like scroll one 2 3 when we're

for example here let's let's make them trigger like scroll one 2 3 when we're loading here so let's do the same here element um element when it's scrolling into view slide up like we did did previously the first one doesn't need a delay you can just go ahead and slide second one let's add scrolling to view slide from the bottom and let's add a 30 milliseconds delay and then the third one let's pick the third one scroll to view um slide from the bottom and let's do 600 so basically will'll have this one and then this one and then this one it will create kind of like a staggering effect let's see if this works so let's preview this and now we're scrolling you see T maybe it was actually too early maybe we need to also give it a little bit of a delay to the first one we can go ahead and play around with this forever but as you can see this is really nice and it's really easy to add really cool effects and animations into our webflow website last I want to make sure that this looks great on mobile phones and you can see right here at the bottom we've got these different break points so this is desktop we can go ahead to tablet mobile portrait and we can go ahead basically

this now it's not going to affect the text on desktop but on mobile it's going to be smaller and this one as well let's do 32 for this one yeah I think this looks much better okay so with that the design is ready and we can go ahead and publish I can go ahead and webflow is giving us a free domain you can see um it's a webflow doio domain of course for professional website we're going to buy a hosting package and you know connect our custom domain but this is already published now this is a fully functional website you see wedding websites web flow.io everything here works we can also go ahead and test out the form V RSVP form oh by the way we did not connect the map that requires us to go to Google Maps and open up an account it's I'm not going to do this right now but it's pretty straightforward to connect the map as well let's do this name here run test and then email not myre email.com three people are going to come and hey I'm testing the form all right let's go ahead and see let's go check my email and see if this actually worked on my email I've got this email web flow form you've received a new submission you can see here that this is the RSVP form for wedding website and you can see name run test email is here people coming three now you understand why it was important to give name to the form item so that we can understand where what message people wrote where so this is it the form works the website works and we have successfully built a fully functional website super fast I hope this video encourages you to build your first website of course there's

professional web designers use to build complex websites website that they chart four and five figures for these days the amount of tools to build websites is overwhelming and some of these tools are actually quite easy to learn tools like Wix and Squarespace however they are easy to learn because they make the process a little bit too simplistic and that leaves you with a generic website definitely not something that you can use on complex interesting projects the tools that I'm going to be using in this video are reloom which will use to plan out the content turn it into wireframe and even select the look and feel for the website then we're going to export this into webflow where we will build all of the additional functionality add interactions make sure the website is responsive and publish the website now some of you might mention that also has their own AI side Builder and if we're just going to get started in weow that's going to be easier and it is however just like I said about Wix and Squarespace I feel like we're going to end up with a two shallow of a template now I personally think that using reum to plan out the content and wireframing is a crucial step and that's actually what's going to separate amateurs from professionals so let's build websites the right way it's going to be super fun let's do it so I've got a new reloom project and I'm starting from the sitemap you can see here at the top then we'll be moving to wireframes and a style guide a sitemap is basically the structure of a website what pages you want and what kind of content sections you're going to have on the website you can think about this like an architectural plan of the website now if I know already how many pages and what I want to have I can go ahead and manually create it however if I'm not sure and I want some help then reim has this AI sitap Creator to help me think through the content of this website so I can put here a prompt in this case let's try invitation to miky and n's wedding including details about the wedding location and RSVP I can't actually specify just a single page so it's 1 to five and then English and then generate a sitemap so let's see what's happening so you can see for the homepage it already created the different sections in what kind of content we're going to have on each section and then it also suggested additional Pages wedding details location RSVP now in this case maybe that's good for the project that you're working on I specifically want just a single page with all of the information so I'm going to go here and start editing this I'm going to delete these pages that I don't need just going to click the three dots and then delete now for the sections let's go through this and there's a little bit of a specifically re is built for you know business websit so in this case you can see by the name of the sections like features list and testimonials I'm not sure it would necessarily make sense for a wedding website but I might edit this so let's see what it suggested and then what kind of changes we want to do so navbar navigation at the top and footer at the bottom this is the basic structure of any website so that's we're always going to have that and then a hero section hero is always the section at the top this one is a welcome message and introduction to mik and n's wedding with a beautiful image of the couple that's actually sounds pretty cool and then featur list section three key highlights wedding dates time venue RSVP instruction that's also sounds pretty good testimonial section quotes from friends and family expressing their joy and excitement for the couple maybe I mean I specifically don't want this but that could be a good idea so I'm just going to select this and hit backspace just to delete it of course I can also write click and delete let's see what is this Services section information about wedding related services such as catering photography and music definitely do not need this I'm going to hit backspace to delete this call to action CTA stands for call to action B basically what do we want people to do encourage visitors to RSVP for the wedding this is exactly what I want although I do want this to be at the end because you know usually people read through a website then they get to the end and choose what they want to do so I'm going to click and drag this to the bottom of the the page where I want people to do this FAQ section common questions about the wedding no I don't want this about section background story of how Mickey and no met in their journey to together that's actually sounds pretty cool uh specifically I'm not sure yeah you know what why not let's just put this as the second one so we've got a welcome then we'll have the background story then we'll have the key highlights I also want another section I do want a gallery with some photos so I'm G to hit the plus here between them and then I'm going to have all of the different section options that I can add here and I'm going to scroll through this we've got a lot of types of contents here and I'm going to choose Gallery so Gallery display

to hit the plus again and um there's actually nothing here with location if I remember correctly but maybe in the contact a lot of time in contact there's like maps and stuff like this so I'm just going to hit the contact I'm going to write here about the location and then how to get there okay I think I'm happy with this structure of the page now if I was working on a client project I might want to share this with them so to get feedback hey are you happy with this is going to be the structure of the homepage or other pages I can do this by clicking the share here and then sharing a link with them and they'll be able to comment and we can have a discussion right now I'm working on this on my own so no problem I can go ahead and move into the next step the wireframing so I'm going to click the wireframe here and I'm going to move into the next step now wireframing is what we called a low Fidelity design what does that mean it means that this is a design without colors without images just for us to understand what kind of content and layouts we have and take a look at the text and as you can see real has already gave us suggestions in terms of what layout to use for example here we have a text left Aline on an image here we've got text on the left and an image on the right it also wrote a copy for us now of course we can doubleclick this and we can uh change the text if it doesn't work for us but it already gave us a really you know a great place to start with and this saves so much time so it gave us the whole page here and again this is just the beginning now I can click each one of these components for example the navigation and you can see I have here replace component so now real is going to suggest me a lot of different layouts and options for the text we can have the logo in the center we can have the logo on the left side we can have the uh you know the navigation centered or it can be right aligned actually I like this one I like it when the navig ation is in the center and then the logo on the left logo we'll have to think about this probably just write Micky and Noom um menu here so let's double click this this is going to be a button for RSVP which is just going to scroll us down the page where we can do the RSVP now and this is going to be kind of like internal scrolling so you can scroll down maybe into the events uh event details details uh maybe into the location and uh actually maybe the first one should be their story right we're going to have their story so I'm just going to grab this to be the first event details location we don't need the last one so I'm happy with this navigation now let's look at this hero section now we might be happy with this again I can go ahead and play around with if I want to have an image or a video maybe I want a button or maybe I want the RSVP here at the top I'm just going to replace this component and let's play around with this I do want something centered align like this yeah I think a lot of time in wedding invitation the text is aligned in the center so I think this is going to be a nice layout a big nice image of them here um of course we can go ahead and redo the text I can also ask reloom to rewrite this shorter longer whatever I want I'm not going to bother about this because obviously you can you understand how to do this on your own um I don't need two buttons here so I'm going to select the learn more and let's just delete to learn more yeah RSVP is enough although we do have RSVP here here it's good to have another one call to action yeah let's just drive them to RSVP here our love story so this is basically the story I guess I don't think we need more buttons here so I'm going to delete the buttons actually just delete them and let's see what other layouts we've have here for the story maybe we have something a little bit more interesting actually let's go with something like this because we're going to have an image at the top we're going to have a gallery below so maybe we don't need that many images okay so I'm happy with this I'm going to delete the buttons don't need the buttons so this section looks good now this is the um this is actually the event details right so I'm just going to write here event details and um this is going to be basically the date I'm just going to write here the date and this is going to be the location and this is going to be dress code because this is what I want right we can rewrite the text of course later on with more information um actually I think it would look good with a little bit of a

delete delete delete okay happy with this we'll see what we're going to do with the design of the icons later on let's look at this so This Is The Gallery yeah we can have this Gallery but I don't really feel this layout let's look for a different component maybe something a little bit more interesting maybe this one this one can feel a little bit like a nice composition photo memories okay this is the location it's good it's with the map and map is what I wanted I'm probably going to change this from email to uh maybe like uh with a car maybe I want you know uh with a train how to get there maybe like open in Google Maps or something like this right and we can of course edit all of these stuff later on lastly join us for the celebration here I actually need the form so let's see if I have a different form form let's see if we have some kind of a form component here so I'm just going to search for form because this is what we need and let's see if I'm getting a form okay so yeah we're getting this form this form yeah this is actually a good form it's a simple form I also would like probably like a drop- down menu where you can select how many people are coming but we're going to do that later on in web flow so I'm just going to write here RSVP I don't know if we need like a tagline um uh of course we're going to yeah you can edit the text later on okay so this is going to be the form and for a footer this is for a way bigger website than what we need so we can go for something way simpler here um yeah something like this is going to be great okay so I feel like we have finished the wireframe I feel like we're happy with the content the structure and basically the layout here and now it's time for us to go ahead and experiment with a little bit of a look and feel for this so I'm heading into the style guide which is a new and cool feature from reloom and basically this lets us very very quickly experiment with different types of color scheme of typography and just experiment with different look and feel so already you can see it gave us a little bit of color and put some images already this feels like a website and not like a wireframe anymore right so let's see what we have here the first thing I actually want to do is I want to replace the images with actual images of Mickey and NS just so that we can actually feel this like how it's going to look like so right here in the preview you can see I have this little icon of edit image and I'm just going to upload my own images and I do have here some images so let's just pick something I feel like yeah this is probably solid for a hero and let's choose that upload that can already tell this color scheme is not going to work for well actually you know what let's see let's see okay for these images here let's go ahead and replace them as well so I'm going to go ahead and upload a bunch of different images you know here let's just see how it looks just select random images of course we can always finalize and make final choices later down the line but I feel like yeah feel like this is pretty pretty solid okay images are uploaded and now okay so now let's tackle first of all we've got the color scheme and then we've got the typography and a little bit of UI style so for the colors the first thing we can do is just Shuffle and just experiment with different palettes but I want to tell you the truth I'm just looking at how this looks like three colors plus Black and Whites for a wedding photography he feels like too much a little bit so the first thing I want to do is I'm just going to get rid of them I just want like very clean maybe just like with one color um and let's see how that would look like so I'm just generating random colors now I have this palette here by the way and we've got also light theme and dark theme and the default here was night theme or dark theme but now it's light already this feels much better in terms for me at least in in terms of color scheme now you can also see here I can go ahead and click and if I click it basically gives me different variations of this color palette so I can have this one as white this one as a little bit of a pale maybe this one let's make this one darker maybe the dark blue yeah this is actually pretty solid this can be white actually I'm happy with with how this maybe this will do this like a", "segment_ids": [253,

palette so I can have this one as white this one as a little bit of a pale maybe this one let's make this one darker maybe the dark blue yeah this is actually pretty solid this can be white actually I'm happy with with how this maybe this will do this like a light light blue okay so now this actually feels pretty good I'm not sure about the color I can go ahead and Shuffle up a few more times I do feel like it's nice that it's kind of like subtle and because the images have a lot of green in them actually here this greenish tone actually not bad and if I want to refine this even further I can click on the but the color itself and then maybe take it to a little bit more greenish like this okay so this feels much better to me so again I suck at colors and this just makes things so much easier for me just to get like good suggestions to get started with and make sure I don't do anything wrong because the most basic mistake I see beginners make is just picking colors that you know are not contrasted it's difficult to read the text they don't work well together so the fact that real is really simplified color selection for me just is huge timesaver all right let's go for look at the the typography this is pretty bold I'm not saying that it can't work for a wedding but I have like a little bit more like an elegant vibe to this website that I want so let's pick the heading now it it asks me of the different types of you know styles that I want and I think I'm going to go with siif feels a little bit more elegant now like a font from serif so which one do I like uh let's like the this one player for display and then get recommendations so already gives me recommendation from free Google fonts that I will be able to use for free on my website and actually even below here we've got Collections and we've got like elegant which is what I'm looking for so let's check out the elegant collection and now I've got a little bit of choices actually a lot of choices and I can click through them and start seeing how they look right here in the preview and this actually looks looks pretty good you know what I'm not even going to try different things cuz I actually like this now for the body which is the smaller text we've got this space for text which actually looks a little bit technical I don't know if it's maybe for a tech company that feels good but for this website uh let's look for something a little cleaner maybe yeah maybe this public Sun just a little bit cleaner yeah feel like it's good now I also have this small normal so let's experiment with this small text large regular large text actually looking at this right now I actually like the large one best although I don't like that we have a single word here so I might change the text a little bit later but in terms of design I actually like the large the large one best in terms of weight I can make this I guess Bolder but I actually like the way that it is here and we also have a style like can space out the letters we can make it uppercase oo this actually looks nice uppercase so let's go with this so I'm going to stay with this yeah type looks much nicer now so I I'm liking this um let's see what else do I have here so we've got the buttons whether I want buttons to be like with an outline with kind of like a shady um what is slick slick let's go with slick rather than elevated no I'm just going to go with a slick card and images oh we also have by the way the round corners so you can see here we've got a little bit of a round corner here I can go with a like a much bigger round corner and I actually think this is nice I like these round corners everything here looks very cute actually so you know what I think that at this point I like this concept but the way professional designers always work is not just making a one design and then going with it they always explore multiple ideas also a lot of times they like to show clients multiple different ideas to pick from so right now we've got this and this is concept number one and you can see here I can pitch Concepts and I can review or compare a few different concepts so let's go here and let's actually go ahead and create a new concept so let's try something else just to see you know if we can get something even better and I'm going to have to upload the images again which is a little bit tedious okay so let's just choose something else just so that we can yeah maybe it looks a little bit different right so I'm just going to do that uh let's replace the photos here as well and see what we're getting this

so this time let's try to do something with a little bit more colors right the previous palette was just like a single color palette let's see what we can do with something else I still feel like we need this to be like a light um color versus like a dark website um let's play around let's Shuffle maybe these kind of like pastel colors can look nicer so let's click here to play around with this peachy peach and purple h it's a little bit too much oh this is actually quite nice no I would keep this like maybe light and this can be maybe white and this is okay okay maybe we'll do this darker or something yeah okay now I feel like we've got enough contrast and interest as we're scrolling in here in terms of typography maybe we do want to have like a different concept here let's see what we have under display display is fonts that look nicer when they're big maybe something like this a real fat face let's see if we can have something a little bit more interesting here hey maybe this one Glock that's also looks pretty pretty elegant I would say I would maybe want to space out the letters a little bit feels feels nicer okay okay okay in here maybe let's try buttons that are actually not round corners let's make it sharp and let's make the images sharp as well just to to see a little bit of a different vibe to this one okay say I'm happy with this I can now go back into Peach concept and you know start debating this I can go ahead and share this with my client if I want I can get feedback I can write a description for each one of the concepts and this is how a real professional would actually work in this case I think I'm happy actually with the first version that we have created so let's say the client or miky and on picked this version and now let's take it to webflow to fully develop it now to export our website into webflow the first thing we need to do is to clone the reom starter file now I just want to say a quick word about web flow web flow is a super super powerful tool and it does have a little bit of a learning cve that's why we have a lot of video tutorials on uh web flow we even have a full-on course on web flow however what I'm going to demonstrate right now requires almost zero understanding in webflow so you'll be able to follow along even if you have no background in web flow so fear nothing right so this starter guide from reloom Al includes a style guide that is BAS basically has all of the styles that we have created here in this style guide so relim is basically going to import everything here and then also the content itself now the way that we're going to do this is we can open up here the webflow apps and we can search for reloom and then we can go ahead and install it on this website now once that is happening we will be able to see the website we've been working on so Miki and Nom's wedding and I'm going to click this and I will be able to see all of the different concepts right so we have concept one and concept two what I want to do is import concept one so continue and then what kind of pages I want to uh import I do want all pages which is basically just a homepage so I'm going to start import and this is going to take a few minutes to bring in all of the content into webflow a few moments later B bam so the import has finish and this took a couple of minutes but it did save us 4 hours because basically usually takes about 30 minutes to build each section and I can attest that this is true this is really really a huge timesaver so now that we've got the whole website inside of webflow let's see what it takes to really bring this website to conclusion to make sure that it's all functional and working so let's start from the top and we've got this navigation we've got this logo here so let's double click this now this is you can see this is a a green instance because this is a component I'm not going to get into as I said Deep Web flow stuff so I'm just going to double click this so I can edit this now in this case we have here like a an image of a logo and I actually don't want this so I'm going to hit the backspace to delete this and I'm actually just going to add like a little bit of a text block right here and I'm just going to write here Mickey and Noom yeah and let me see if this is actually inside of yeah it's inside of the navbar logo link which is where it should be now I do want it to be kind of like in the style of the website so as I've mentioned we do have a style guide here so already reim has created all of these styles for us and you can see here I'm going to try to apply this style and you can see here this is called heading style H6 so let's go ahead and try to apply this style which you can see here in the style panel right here let's try to apply

double click choose this text and under the Styles I'm just going to write H6 and here we go heading style H6 it's this one so I'm going to apply it and immediately I have this Tex style here which now it looks great looks like yeah it's yeah looks like part of the website for now okay next I want to make sure that these buttons actually work so I want the story button to take us to the story section event details location and RSVP now to do that we actually need to give each of these section an ID so that we can connect it so we can tell it hey scroll to that specific section now the way that we do this so let's start with a story I'm going to go here let's say this is a story and I'm going to open up the Navigator so you can see we have this section right now it's section layout 134 under the settings panel right here on the right we have an ID so let's call this story I'm going to add an ID of story again this right this is great for event details I'm going to do the same right so I'm going to choose the next section and add an idea of details and then what else do we have location maybe so it's this section let's call this location and then the last section which is this one let's call this section RSVP so now these sections have different ideas and I can go through here and I can edit the links so I'm clicking this and under the settings here you can see where this is linking to you can add a link you can link to a different page what we want to do is link to a section on the page and I'm just going to go here you can see we already have a little bit of names of different elements here but what I want to link to is this one is the story so let's go to the story event details let's do the same here to details location let's do the same here for location in RSVP let's look for the link and choose the RSVP now let's test this so I'm going to hit the preview button here and I'm going to test the story scrolling into the story this is great event details is scrolling to the event details location scrolling to the location perfect RSVP is scrolling into the RSVP this is fantastic all right we also probably need to connect this button so let's do the same here page section RSVP okay so now we've got a functioning navigation and buttons the next thing we wanted to do is to replace these icons okay so where are we going to get icons I'm going to go to Icon finder that's my favorite place to get free icons super fast so we can go here and uh what was the icon so first one is the date so so I'm going to search for date and let's see I want to look for free icons I want to make sure they are outlined that's the style that I want and yeah maybe this one is is actually pretty good let's see what we need here this is like a black icon yeah so this icon can actually work as it is right so I can just click download SVG and let's call this date let's also look for the other one so we've got location and dress code so location let's look for location let's see what we have um this one looks good to me so I'm going to choose this one and download an SVG SVG means this is a vector um which means this is a small file it means it's not going to be pixelated so this is really great last one is dress code so I'm just going to do address and let's see if there's add dress here that I like yeah maybe this one feels good let's download the SVG and uh fantastic okay in webflow I'm going to head into the assets panel which is right here and I'm going to hit upload and on my desktop I've got these three icons I'm going to open them and let's see see them okay they're all in here so now I can just double click this icon and replace this one the date I can replace with the date location I can replace with the location and dress code I'm going to replace with the dress okay okay so event detail this section also looks great what else do we have here okay lastly we want to make sure that this form actually works okay so first thing that I've noted is we want to have this drop- down menu where we can select how many people are coming let's actually see if um in the style guide maybe we already have a drop-down menu we can just copy and paste because a lot of times we do have form elements in here let's scroll through this there we go so form elements and uh we have text area filled label form input there's no here we go so

have a drop-down menu we can just copy and paste because a lot of times we do have form elements in here let's scroll through this there we go so form elements and uh we have text area filled label form input there's no here we go so this is a select this is called a select like a drop- down menu so I'm just going to click this I'm going to copy this so command C to copy I'm going to go back into the homepage and let's scroll here and let's actually just click the form and paste it now I don't need this at the button so let's see where it is let's see where it's pasted form input let's actually go ahead and after the because you can see here we actually have a a kind of like a a group that holds together a wrapper that holds together this input of what is this field and then the actual field so let's let's copy one of these copy this and then delete Del this form input and inside put this thing just so that we can have this label which we can write here how many people will come probably don't need to capitalize this and in the select element I can under the setting I can choose the options right so maybe this one is going to say just one person and the value is basically what it's going to send to us so I do want this just to say one and send one cu of course this can mean different things but for me it's just going to be two and two three and three and uh four and four maybe let's actually add another option which is can't come or something like this can't come and the value is not coming okay now you can see that these fields also have names this is important because when we're going to get an email when somebody submit this form this is what's going to tell us it's going to return something like field n two because somebody submitted the value two under field n so here let's call this um you know people or how how should we say this like people coming maybe people coming that's okay let's see what the the names of these fields are contact name now I'm just going to write here name under email um remove the contact one so just email this one we know people coming and this is going to be just message I'm just going to remove the contact one and then I don't need this terms and T so I'm just going to delete this whole thing we don't need this okay so I think the form is ready actually when I'm selecting the whole form here under the setting I can actually see you know a different settings here first of all what is the name of the form I'm going to call this RSVP form and I've got all of these form fields that is correct now this is what's going to happen when people submit this now currently we're doing something very simple which is just sending a an email when somebody submits a form of course we can do something more advanced to sync to like a database that checks if this person is invited and Mark yes no we can do something more elaborate but I'm keeping things really simple here just send an email right now it's sending an email to to myself but um of course I can add here an email of clients or somebody else so for now just send an email to me when it's yeah when it's submitted that's great and uh we can see here success message so this is what's going to look like after somebody submits thank you submission has been received or error if for some reason something didn't work of course we can style and edit these and uh yeah I think the form is actually ready right now let's preview this just so that we can see we can typee here and we can choose here from the drop- down menu um so this is working and we're going to try this in a minute of course we can go ahead and um adjust the footer as well but you've basically seen how I've did that before so it's more interesting to me to add a little bit of interactions to the website right now so let's let's make this a little bit more like sexy where things like fade in as we're loading and and stuff like this so the first thing I want to do is maybe pick this uh this whole text area now basically I can select just you know this heading or this or the button but you can see that they are grouped together inside of this it's called Max with large that's basically the the style or basically this whole thing here is grouping the whole text together so let's animate this here under the interactions I can go ahead ahead and create an element Trigger or a page trigger basically we want when the page is loading or basically this gets into the view we want this to fade in so let's add something like scroll into view now this is actually not going to scroll into view because it's just going to be here when we're loading but that's what we want to do right now and what we can do when it's scrolling into the view we can either create a custom animation we've got a lot of very cool pre um you know readymade animation for us in this case let's choose the slide and you can preview this is how it's going to animate from the left let's choose from the bottom yeah this is nice", "segment_ids": [749, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 762, 763, 764, 765, 766, 767, 768, 769, 770, 771, 772, 773, 774, 775, 776,

the view we want this to fade in so let's add something like scroll into view now this is actually not going to scroll into view because it's just going to be here when we're loading but that's what we want to do right now and what we can do when it's scrolling into the view we can either create a custom animation we've got a lot of very cool pre um you know readymade animation for us in this case let's choose the slide and you can preview this is how it's going to animate from the left let's choose from the bottom yeah this is nice okay so I'm happy with this and I also want to animate maybe this header image here I'm going to do the same but I want first the text and then the image so let's add another scroll into view to this slide from the bottom but for this I'm going to add like a 300 milliseconds delay to this let's see what happens now if I preview so now you can see that we've got the text sliding in and then the image sliding in and that's nice right that gives like a nice feel when we're loading this website and we can go ahead and add more stuff for example here let's let's make them trigger like scroll one 2 3 when we're loading here so let's do the same here element um element when it's scrolling into view slide up like we did did previously the first one doesn't need a delay you can just go ahead and slide second one let's add scrolling to view slide from the bottom and let's add a 30 milliseconds delay and then the third one let's pick the third one scroll to view um slide from the bottom and let's do 600 so basically will'll have this one and then this one and then this one it will create kind of like a staggering effect let's see if this works so let's preview this and now we're scrolling you see T maybe it was actually too early maybe we need to also give it a little bit of a delay to the first one we can go ahead and play around with this forever but as you can see this is really nice and it's really easy to add really cool effects and animations into our webflow website last I want to make sure that this looks great on mobile phones and you can see right here at the bottom we've got these different break points so this is desktop we can go ahead to tablet mobile portrait and we can go ahead basically everything should be fine because the reloom components are already responsive and it does look pretty good I can say for example well I actually think this is a little bit too big so I can go here into the styling and make changes for example the size is 48 pixels Maybe reduces to 35 or something like this now it's not going to affect the text on desktop but on mobile it's going to be smaller and this one as well let's do 32 for this one yeah I think this looks much better okay so with that the design is ready and we can go ahead and publish I can go ahead and webflow is giving us a free domain you can see um it's a webflow doio domain of course for professional website we're going to buy a hosting package and you know connect our custom domain but this is already published now this is a fully functional website you see wedding websites web flow.io everything here works we can also go ahead and test out the form V RSVP form oh by the way we did not connect the map that requires us to go to Google Maps and open up an account it's I'm not going to do this right now but it's pretty straightforward to connect the map as well let's do this name here run test and then email not myre email.com three people are going to come and hey I'm testing the form all right let's go ahead and see let's go check my email and see if this actually worked on my email I've got this email web flow form you've received a new submission you can see here that this is the RSVP form for wedding website and you can see name run test email is here people coming three now you understand why it was important to give name to the form item so that we can understand where what message people wrote where so this is it the form works the website works and we have successfully built a fully functional website super fast I hope this video encourages you to build your first website of course there's so much more to learn about web design to be able to create beautiful professional websites but the most important thing is that you actually get started and when you're ready to level up make sure you check out our food
